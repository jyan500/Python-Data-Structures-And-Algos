https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/
Concept: 
1) The goal is to create a structure like below which acts as a DB, where we keep track of 
followers, following, and tweets in a set()
- this happens as users post tweets, follow, etc

2) Whenever we post a tweet, track both the tweet id and a timestamp (which is just an increasing counter value in this case)
in a tuple
3) Note that followers and following are considered user ids, so we can use them to query our structure

followee = person that you are following
follower = person that is following

4) Whenever a user follows someone, you need to add to two lists, add the follower to the "following" list for one user,
and then add the followee to the "followed" list of the other user
5) Whenever a user unfollows someone, you remove the follower from the "followed" list, and you also remove the followee from the "following" list

6) Whenever we request a news feed, 
takes the tweet lists from all the users in the "following",
as well as all of the requested user's own tweets. Sort in reverse and take the top 10

getNewsFeed is the most expensive operation here, 
O(N) to retrieve all the tweets of the users in the "following" list (probably more due to the conversion
from set to list)
O(NLogN) to sort them

Alternatively you can use a heap to store the news feed elements, adding only up to 10:

{
    user id 1: {
        followers: set(),
        following: set(),
        feed: [],
        tweets: set()
    },
    user id 2: {
        ...
    },
    ...
}

    Revisited on 10/2/2024
    using the heap solution suggested by Neetcode,
    https://neetcode.io/problems/design-twitter-feed
    but a slight difference where the tweets are kept per user in the self.users dict,
    and uses a max heap, with the 
    count of tweets set to negative right before pushing into the max heap.
    Time: O(10LogK * KLogK), where K is the amount of tweets in each following list, and 10 is the amount of tweets that we need
    to retrieve in the newsfeed. 
    The 10LogK is because in the while (maxHeap) loop, we might need to do a heappush, which is LogK,
    up to 10 times. 
    Whereas for KLogK, that is the initial loop where we push the last index of each tweet list from each user onto the maxheap.
    Space: O(N), where N is the total amount of tweets made
