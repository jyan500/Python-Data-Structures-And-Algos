        Time Complexity: O(NLogN + (N * 2^N))
        in order to prevent us from choosing a duplicate,
        we will sort so that after choosing all nums[i] in our subset,
        when backtracking and determining the "next" number we 
        should choose, we can perform a loop to continue
        iterating our i index until it reaches the next number != current number.
        And then continuing the recursion down that index instead. Otherwise,
        if we continued the recursion down i + 1, we'd get duplicate subsets.
        for example:
        1,2,2,3
        at i = 4, if choosing every nums[i], you'd get 1,2,2,3 in the subset.
        at i = 3, you'd get [1,2,2] by not including 3
        when backtracking to i = 2, you'd get [1,2] by not including i = 2 in the subset,
        this would get [1,2,3]
        backtracking to i = 1, this is where the while loop comes in.
        we don't want to include i = 2, otherwise this would give us duplicate subsets 
        since it "reincludes" the value of 2.
        so the while loop moves the pointer to i = 3
        so we'd start from [1] and get [1,3] once choosing the nums[i] at i = 3.
