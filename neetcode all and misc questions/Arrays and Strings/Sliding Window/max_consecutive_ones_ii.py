        sliding window
        Approach:
        l = 0, r = 0
        if we see a 1, add to cur, and also set the max(cur, maxCur)
        if we see a 0, we need to check whether we've seen an index where 0 was found
            if we haven't
                increment cur 
                set last occurrence of zero to r 
            else:
                we need to decrement the amount of places based on the difference between
                the last occurrence of zero + 1 and the left pointer 
                for example, if the last occurrence of zero was at i = 4, and l = 2, we'd do 
                cur -= last occurrence of zero + 1 - left pointer, since we also include the current placement as an extra "one" value that's being subtracted
                we'd then need to shift the left pointer to the last occurrence of zero + 1
                set the last occurrence of zero to None
                continue
                

        r = 0 nums[r] is 1, cur = 1, maxCur = 1
        r = 1 nums[r] is 0, flipped = True, cur = 2, maxCur = 2
        r = 2 nums[r] is 1, cur = 3, maxCur = 3
        r = 3 nums[r] is 0, we have to move the left pointer until the last occurrence of 0 is found, and increment once more
        l = 2, cur = 1
        r = 3  nums[r] is 0, this time, flipped = False, so we can set to True. And increment cur = 2
        r = 4 nums[r] is 1, increment cur = 3

        answer is 3
