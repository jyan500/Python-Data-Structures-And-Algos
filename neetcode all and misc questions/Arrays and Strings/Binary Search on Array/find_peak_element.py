        The problem states that: nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž
        which means that say if had 
        [1 2 3 4 5],
        5 is considered a peak element because it's greater than 4, and also greater than its neighbor
        outside of the boundaries of the array

        same with
        [5 4 3 2 1]
        5 is considered a peak element because it's greater than 4, and also greater than its neighbor 
        outside of the boundaries of the array
    
        The key to the problem is recognizing this fact, and then checking to see if the element to the right
        is greater than the current element. If so, that means this current element CANNOT be the peak element,
        HOWEVER, the next element COULD be a peak element. If the pattern continues where the element
        to the right is greater than the current, we're guaranteed to run into the peak element at the end of the array.

        Same logic applies if the array is monotonically decreasing,
        If the element to the right is less than the current, we have to search the left side instead,
        as this means the the element to the left is greater than the current, so the peak element
        is on the left side (with the last possible peak element being the element at index 0)
