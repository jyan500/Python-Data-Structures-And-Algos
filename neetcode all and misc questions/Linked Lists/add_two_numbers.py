'''
ou are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1: 
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

        Revisited 3/6/2025 with a similar solution
        because the numbers in the LL are stored in reverse order, they're in the same order
        that we normally use when performing addition (starting from the end first)

        if the two digits sum >= 10, save a carryover of 1, and save sum - 10 to the new LL

        it's also easier to pad the shorter LL with 0's on the back
        for example
        342 + 4 would be the equivalent of
        342 + 004
        which is the equivalent of these two LL's
        4 -> 0 -> 0
        2 -> 4 -> 3,
        so the padding occurs on the backside

        This solution is improved and doesn't use any intermediate arrays
        https://neetcode.io/problems/add-two-numbers

        because the numbers are stored in reverse order, we can start adding the two digits
        starting from the beginning of each linked list, as this is the same order as we'd do 
        by-hand addition.

        track a carryover at 0, and whenever we add the values + existing carryover, 
        check if the sum >= 10
        if so, the value we set is 10 - 10, and the carryover is 1. If the sum is < 10,
        we just set the value as the sum and set the carryover to 0

        In the case we finish iterating and there's still carryover,
        set a remaining next node with a value of 1

        In the case the linked lists are not the same length, it's easier to pad the shorter
        linked list with nodes with value 0 to make edge case handling easier. So I would first
        iterate through both linked lists until you get to the last non-null value, and as the other LL continues,
        I'd add new list nodes onto the shorter linked list with value 0.

Revisited 9/8/2023
O(N) Time and O(N) memory solution
1) convert both linked lists into arrays
2) create a temp array while adding the numbers together
3) If sum of digits > 10, placeholder = sum % 10 and carry over is always 1 (max should be 9 + 9, so carry over 1 and then placeholder 8)
we add the placeholder to the temp array to represent the digit and then carry over 1. 
If there's no carryover because the sum of digits < 10, just the sum of digits + carryover
4) If len(l1) != len(l2), account for additional spots to cover carryover after the last digit of the shorter linked list 
by padding shorter list with zeroes (i.e 99999+999 is effectively 99999+00999 when performing carryover addition)
5) If there's an additional carryover at the end, add to the temp array
6) convert temp array back to linked list
