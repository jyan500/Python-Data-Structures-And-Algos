        Neetcode's Heap Solution:
        1) Sort the trips array by the starting location
        2) Keep a min heap that tracks the dropoff location
        3) if the top of the minheap's dropoff location <= current pickup location,
        this means we could've dropped these passengers off, so continue dropping off before picking up new passengers
        Time: O(NLogN) + O(NLogK)
        Space: O(N)

        The key pattern with these problems (and the CPU/task scheduling problems) is rather than incrementing
        time/location by one to see what the state is at each time, we can jump to a specific time, and then check if a particular condition
        is met to pop off a heap/queue (for example, we jump from one pickup location to the next, and then check if the current pickup location > dropoff location,
        rather than incrementing a location variable by one until we reach a dropoff, and then dropoff, or pickup if location == pickup, as that could create many idle states)

        My first accepted solution using similar concept to meeting rooms II:
        car
        A - - - - - - - - B
          from       to
        trips = [[2,1,5], [3,3,7]] capacity = 4
        at 1, pick up 2 passengers, capacity is now 2
        at 3, pick up 3 passengers, capacity is now -1 which is invalid
        
        trips = [[2,1,5], [3,3,7]] capacity = 5
        at 1, pick up 2 passengers, capacity is now 2
        at 3, pick up 3 passengers, capacity is now 5
        at 5, drop off 2 passengers, capacity is now 3
        at 7, drop off 3 passengers, capacity is now 7
        
        This is actually very similar to meetings room II in concept,
        where you separate out the pickup and dropoff locations, and then track two pointers where you check if the dropoff <= pickup, then you increment the dropoff pointer instead of the pickup pointer. Except you would
        also store the capacity as a tuple of (pickUpAmt, pickupLocation) or 
        (dropOffAmt, dropoffLocation)
