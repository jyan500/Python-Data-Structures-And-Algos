# As of 9/29/2024
## Current Well Practiced Problem Types on Neetcode (from top to bottom)
* Searching in 2D Arrays involving DFS or BFS (i.e Number of Islands)
* Backtracking and 1-D Dynamic Programming using Memoization (i.e combinations, etc)
* K types of problems that involve Heaps
* Array and String problems (to some extent, hashmap, two pointer problems, sliding window, easier prefix and suffix problems)
* Easy - medium interval problems
* Easy - medium tree problems
* Easy - medium binary search problems

## Areas to Improve (top to bottom)
* Stacks and Queues (knowing when to use stacks vs queues for a problem)
* Graphs problems (specifically when the questions does not mention graphs within it, but you have to identify it as a graph problem)
* Problems that involve using multiple data structures (usually these are Hards)
* Heap problems that are not the "top K or K closest" types of problems (such as Task Scheduler)
* Linked Lists
