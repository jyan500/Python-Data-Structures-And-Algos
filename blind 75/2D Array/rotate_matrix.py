'''
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, 
which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Solution explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCciKhaK2v8&ab_channel=FisherCoder

idea: transpose the diagonal items to create an intermediate state, then reverse the start and end of each item in the 
row to get the final result

1) reverse each row
2) iterate through the matrix diagonally starting from the top right corner
    - for each diagonal, swap the first and last elements of the diagonal
i.e you can also iterate through an inverted "L" shape, starting from the topmost "L",
performing a swap at each iteration

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

reverse each row

3 2 1
6 5 4
9 8 7 

If you do the L shaped iterations and swapping:

1 gets swapped with itself ( no effect )

the 2 and 4 get swapped 

3 4 1
6 5 2
9 8 7

The 3 and 7 get swapped

7 4 1 
6 5 2
9 8 3

The 6 and 8 get swapped

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

The 9 gets swapped with itself (no effect)

final answer is 

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

O(N^2) time
O(N^2) space
